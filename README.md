# Idea Stack - A Google Assistant Action

Ever having a conversation, get caught up doing something else and when you come back, forget what you were talking about? If so, Stack App might be for you!

Stack App allows you to save your thoughts/conversation topics in a stack whenever you are about to get sidetracked so you could remember them for later!

Say you're talking about dolphins but realize it's time to leave for work. Say "Stack App push dolphins" to remember it. Now after you're done work and have time to chat again, say "Stack App peek" or "Stack App pop" to retrieve dolphins. Then, you could continue your conversation, just where you left off!
