Ever having a conversation, get caught up doing something else and when you come back, forget what you were talking about? If so, Idea Stack might be for you!

Idea Stack allows you to save your thoughts/conversation topics in a stack whenever you are about to get sidetracked so you could remember them for later!

Say you're talking about dolphins but realize it's time to leave for work. Say "Idea Stack push dolphins" to remember it. Now after you're done work and have time to chat again, say "Idea Stack peek" or "Idea Stack pop" to retrieve dolphins. Then, you could continue your conversation, just where you left off!

Source code note: most of the work and configuration was on the [Actions Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), rather than in written code, hence why there isn't all too much code in this repo
